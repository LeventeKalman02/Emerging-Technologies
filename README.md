## Tasks
### What this section is about and what does it do:

The Trigrams.ipynb File is a file containing Python Code to create Trigrams from books in the Books folder. 
There were 3 Tasks to be completed:
- Task 1: Third-order letter approximation model
  - This Task counts the number of times each sequence of three characters (that is, each trigram) appears in a text. For example, the sentence: It is what it is. would become IT IS WHAT IT IS. This will give a model like {'IT ': 2, 'T I': 3, ' IS': 2, 'IS ': 1, ...}.
- Task 2: Third-order letter approximation generation
- Task 3: Analyze your model
